# Moving test (aka myHomebrew4)

Simple homebrew I made. It's just moving ASCII character on screen

# How to build

Get devkitARM (created by [devkitPro](http://devkitpro.org)) and [ctrulib](https://github.com/smealum/ctrulib). Make sure they are in $PATH variable. Then just run `make` and put .3dsx file to 3DS (or run using [Citra](https://citra-emu.org))

# Controls

* D-PAD - change direction
* L/R - change moving speed
* Start - quit the app
